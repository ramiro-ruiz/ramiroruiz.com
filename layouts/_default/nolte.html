  <h1>Nolte UX Designer Evaluation Test</h1>
  <p>Hello Jeffrey, Gaby, and Benjamin.</p>
  <p>After the nice chat I had with Gabriela she told me a little bit about this next step, I went right away to the website and started taking note on the things that can improve the experience of the visitors.</p>
  <p>Then I received the email with the brief about what the test is about.</p>

  <h2>Nolte website redesign</h2>
  <p>To determine how to approach a project I first have to talk with the client, to get a better understanding of what they have on their mind and help them translate that into words. Now that things are more clear I can see what they actually need and work together to go in hand with what they want.</p>
  <p>In this case, I just have a document, so they will be a lot of assumptions. The assignment:</p>
  <blockquote class="full-width">
    Develop a high level plan and approach to redesigning the Nolte website from a UX perspective.
  </blockquote>
  <p>To approach this I need the goals of the project</p>

  <h3>Nolte website goals</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li>Increase understanding of Nolte and its value proposition.</li>
  	<li>Convey trust with existing and prospective clients and partners.</li>
  	<li>Convert visitors into leads.</li>
  	<li>Convey our design, technical and product management experience.</li>
  	<li>Increase time on site and overall readership.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Now It’s time to see the current website, as the document doesn’t have what are the flaws they encounter, the pain points that are encouraging the redesign. So I browse the site to look and guess the things they want to improve.</p>

  <img class="full-width" src="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}/i/nolte/home-clicks.png">
  <h3>UX audit list</h3>
  <p>This is the list that I end up with:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li> Signup email banner background color is the same as the hero, it’s confusing as you can’t distinguish well between the two.</li>
  	<li> The site asks you permission for notifications, even as a first-time visitor, it doesn’t set the best impression when I haven’t yet interact with the site. It may look spammy.</li>
  	<li> The always present subscribe to notifications doesn’t give you any context, why would I get if I subscribe, same with the signup for email updates banner.</li>
  	<li> On my first visit I needed four click actions before I can comfortably browse the site:

  		<ol>
  			<li> To close the signup for email updates banner</li>
  			<li> To close the chat window</li>
  			<li> To deny notifications</li>
  			<li> To accept cookies</li>
  		</ol>
      We can improve this number a lot.
    </li>
    <li> The arrow down to see the content takes you instantly there, that regularly causes confusion as the user may don’t realize where that link took them, a smooth transition would help and use a little of JavaScript to avoid leaving the anchor id #content in the URL so the browser back button behaves and user would expect it.</li>
  	<li> There’s a bug on mobile the page doesn’t fit the width, there’s a small horizontal scroll, that is because of the list #menu-footermenu, changing the width to 100% on the max-width: 450px media query fixes that.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Now after exploring the current site and having the previous notes in mind we can start, looking closely to the goals in order we have:</p>

  <h2 class="goal">Increase understanding of Nolte and its value proposition.</h2>
  <p>Which is still not completely clear for me, the first you read is</p>
  <blockquote class="full-width">
    We create high-quality technology by partnering with the world’s most forward-thinking companies.
  </blockquote>

  <p>That describes the <strong>What</strong>, you can get an idea of what Nolte do. In the services you can read the <strong>How</strong> and on the Mission you can get a glimpse of the <strong>Why</strong> but it can be more specific and it would help to be the hero text. Ideally, the copy should mention the three in there. </p>

  <h2 class="goal">Convey trust with existing and prospective clients and partners.</h2>
  <p>It is mentioned in many parts on the site, how Nolte is focused in building relationships and I really like that, it is the best way to make great work and I’m sure is what existing clients and prospects want. I think we can still reinforce that with proof.</p>
  <p>Having articles or case studies with results of ongoing client projects, would help a lot.</p>

  <h2 class="goal">Convert visitors into leads.</h2>
  <p>That’s obviously a hard one, but we can absolutely improve our numbers by understanding our target audience and unique value proposition. With that, we can build and design for our target and communicate our unique value proposition like how our audience wants it to hear so as they arrive in the site they’ll say “I am in the right place.”</p>

  <h2 class="goal">Convey our design, technical and product management experience.</h2>
  <p>In this regard, the website has to show the design and technical experience of the team, it is not easy to make new and complex things while maintaining simplicity and good UX but it is possible. Another thing that shows experience is with side projects from the team and share them, as well as writing more and keep sharing knowledge to the community. </p>
  <p>As with the product management experience can be shown in the completed projects and how successful they turn out, that can be reinforced on the case studies.</p>

  <h2 class="goal">Increase time on site and overall readership.</h2>
  <p>This one is interesting because I would think that the time on an agency site is irrelevant as the faster the visitors are encouraged to contact us or make an action like subscribing, the better. Being concise and compact so we don’t need many pages to convince them. </p>
  <p>The only place where I see the importance of time on the site is in the blog section, and with good, detailed or more content the readership will increase.</p>

  <h2>Approach</h2>
  <p>So after analyzing the goals and the current site, we have a good start, now one way to continue is by doing a <em>design sprint</em> to explore more and end up with a solid foundation that we can keep building on top of.</p>
  <img class="full-width" src="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}/i/nolte/design-sprint.jpg">

  <h3>Other option</h3>
  <p>Is not always easy to get the time of all the profile we would need to run one, so the other way I would do it is by starting with a mood board, to set the tone and style.</p>
  <p>From there I’ll sketch and wireframe a lot of ideas and possible solutions, to take the good ones to Sketch or Figma and keep exploring with variations. </p>
  <img src="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}/i/nolte/element-collages.png">
  <p>I’m a big believer in element collages, atomic design and bringing design to the browser as soon as possible. So I don’t waste a lot of time of finishing complete detailed pages in static software as it would never look or function the same with actual code, I sometimes build micro interactions in Principle to explore animations before coding them.</p>
  <p>What I’ve been recently doing is to design first the most interesting or complex parts, examples can be the hero section, buttons, menu, etc. and break them down in to atoms, molecules and organisms so I can group them as components to start coding and organizing those bits using SASS in a way that I’m creating a pattern library from the beginning, I’ve been playing with Fractal but want to try Pattern Lab to compare them. </p>
  <img src="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}/i/nolte/pattern-library.png">
  <p>That would be very helpful for future versions or make it easy to keep iterating specific elements so it can be on a continuous improvement. I will keep doing more components until I can form complete pages of the site. </p>
  <p>From then on is now matter of integrating the front-end, It looks like you guys use WordPress so I would not have any problems integrating it as I have many years of experience working and creating custom themes from scratch in WordPress.</p>
  <p>Even so, for a site like this one I would prefer to use something more simple and easy to maintain like a Static Site Generator, I build mine with Hugo and is been a really amazing experience.</p>

  <h3>Team needed</h3>
  <p>For this project, I would need someone to help me with the copy, other than that I can design and develop the whole site but if the deadline is tight, another front-end engineer would speed the process.</p>

  <h3>Test questions</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li>
      <strong class="block">How much time did you spend?</strong>
      7 hrs.
    </li>
  	<li>
      <strong class="block">Which methods or activities would you perform if you could have more time?</strong>
      Actually, make some visual proposals. A quick one is the <strong>fonts</strong>, Butler the one being used in the headings, doesn’t match that well with the logo with those thin finish on the serifs, both have a different style and are fighting each other to dominate the entire style of the site.
    </li>
  	<li>
      <strong class="block">What are some of the struggles you faced along the way?</strong>
      Deciding what to include and how to deliver this test plan.
    </li>
  	<li>
      <strong class="block">Assign a rating of difficulty on this test (1 = easy / 10 = difficult).</strong>
      Just as a test I would give it a 6.
    </li>
  	<li>
      <strong class="block">Key takeaways from the project.</strong>
      <p>It's always easier to see a point on things already build, but this made me explore and read more from the agency and all the cool stuff you've been doing.</p>
      <p>If you want to keep using serif to give a more formal look I would recommend using <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter">Bitter</a> but other good options would be:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Serif/">PT Serif</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab/">Roboto Slab</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rokkitt">Rokkitt</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bree+Serif/">Bree Serif</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>And that would be the overall plan. Thank you.</p>
