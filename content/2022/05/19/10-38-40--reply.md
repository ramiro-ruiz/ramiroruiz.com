  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/@ramiroruiz">@ramiroruiz</a> Does paying the subscription price for 1-2 months save you more than doing it yourself? For me I usually weight that option before doing it myself 😁. Some time I still end up doing it myself thou 😜</p>

There’s is one that looks too time consuming  to do it myself, so if it gets traction is the first one I’ll pay.

The main thing is that I want a quick and cheap way to start before bring someone to do it properly. I don’t want to grow it inside of WordPress for long.
