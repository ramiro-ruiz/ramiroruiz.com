  <p>I was recently asked where I stay up to date with web and tech. Twitter, of course but I also review a few websites, Instagram and frequent many Discord and Slack communities. What about you?</p>

For me is mostly Twitter, newsletters and a few RSS feeds. 
I use to join various slack communities but it was too much noise.
