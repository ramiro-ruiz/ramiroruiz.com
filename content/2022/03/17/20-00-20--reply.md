  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/@ramiroruiz">@ramiroruiz</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/@rosiesherry">@rosiesherry</a> Hey there Ramiro. Which part are thinking might be time-consuming, building the company or ensuring it's community-led?</p><p> I'm a mom too and can relate.

Happy to being proven wrong. But my model doesn’t expect to charge people from the community.
