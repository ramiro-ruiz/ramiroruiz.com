I’m finishing my new shortcut to quickly publish blog posts. This is one of my main focuses on this new redesign. The [last version](https://v3.ramiroruiz.com) had a lot of required things that added friction to the blogging experience. I wrote very little as a result.

Now I’m starting very flexible, no need to define a featured image or a post color. No defined text length, and more importantly, no need to open my computer to write and publish.

Right now, I’m doing everything from my iPad, but I can also do it from my phone, and of course, the computer too. I’m writing it in [bear](https://bear.app) and sharing the note through an iOS shortcut. Still using the same I use for the [notes](https://ramiroruiz.com/all-notes), I just added a few changes to have the option for blog posts.

So now that I don’t have an excuse anymore, you should be seeing more from me.
