One of my greatest strengths is my desire to learn and discover new things. I’ve always been naturally curious, and this curiosity drives me to seek out new knowledge and experiences. Whether it’s learning a new skill, researching a topic that interests me, or just trying something new, I love the process of learning and discovery.

But there’s a difference between just learning something new at a surface level and actually knowing something really well. That’s where I fall short. In the past, when I became passionate about something, I would go all in. But in the past few years, since starting a family, it’s been a challenge to find the time and focus to really dive deep into things.

One example is writing. I’ve been wanting to improve my writing, but it’s been hard to find the time and motivation to write regularly, especially with all my other responsibilities and commitments. I’ve realized that pure motivation isn’t enough, at least not for me in this area.

That’s why I’ve been trying to write more on my phone - it makes it easier for me to carve out time for writing, since I always have it with me and there are always small moments of time I can take advantage of. And if I need to, I can always go back and edit my work on my computer.

Ultimately, as with most things, the important thing is to start. Whether it’s learning a new skill, writing more regularly, or trying something new, the first step is always the hardest. But once I start, the momentum carries me forward and helps me make progress.

This time, I’m also making finishing things a priority. Whether it’s writing a post, designing an idea that’s been in my head, or creating a simple repository of something new I’m learning, I want to make sure I see things through to the end. That’s why I’m excited to start new habits and see where they take me for this 2023.
