*A **[Colophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing))** is an inscription at the end of a book or manuscript usually with facts about its production. Including details about typographic style, the fonts used, the paper used, and perhaps the binding method of the book.*

## About the site
This website is my online home. It is not perfect and is constantly evolving as myself. It is a bit more inclined to the personal side than the professional one. Like a digital playground where I can experiment with new technologies, share and collect some of my ideas and interests.

## Design
There’s an old ongoing joke about designers struggling with creating or updating their portfolios. And it’s true. It’s hard to be your own client. Since I wasn't been entirely happy with any of the many design variations I was working on. I went ahead and took the MVP route.

Having a good enough base to keep building on top of it. I know I will never be fully satisfied so I’ll eventually build a site changelog to document the many upcoming improvements to this version.

Talking about versions, this is my 4th one.
It has a strong focus on typography and white space, like a blank foundation to build upon.

You’re free to view the past and somewhat embarrassing versions.
- [1st Version (2011)](https://v1.ramiroruiz.com)
- [2nd Version (2016)](https://v2.ramiroruiz.com)
- [3rd Version (2018)](https://v3.ramiroruiz.com)

## Typography
I’m using two variable fonts on the site and I’m hosting them locally. [Work Sans](https://github.com/weiweihuanghuang/Work-Sans) by [Wei Huang](http://weiweihuanghuang.github.io/) and [Zodiak](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/zodiak) by [Indian Type Foundry](https://www.indiantypefoundry.com/)


## Technology
I use [GitHub](https://github.com/)  to manage the source code and the site is host d and automatically deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

This website is currently built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. With my custom-made theme {{<strong weight="500">}}*(V4)*{{</strong>}}.

I fine-tune design details on the site’s pattern library that I built using [Fractal](http://fractal.build).

### Posting content
Blog posts are usually written in  [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) using [Bear](https://bear.app/) and pushed to my repo using a [Shortcut](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) I made that uses GitHub’s API.

Most of my [notes](https://ramiroruiz.com/notes) are first posted on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ramiroruiz) and then syndicated to the site.

### IndieWeb
I’m all about what [The IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) stands for, and I’m still far from completely *IndieWebify* my site but I’m working on it.

I receive and show [Webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) on my posts thanks to [Webmention.io](https://webmention.io/).

While I did some tests and was able to publish using [Micropub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub) clients too. I choose to not use them because of the bilingual nature of my site. I try to have most of my posts in both languages and I was able to create a workflow that works for me using a series of shortcuts. I’m sure it can be done with code but currently, that’s beyond the knowledge of this designer.

## Web analytics
I’m using [Umami](https://umami.is/), a simple and self-hosted web privacy-focused analytics solution.
