  @brian_lovin ‚úãüèº I‚Äôve been in that position twice. First time I was able to sell the idea of a DS but I had to own that project. As the only designer I just had 25% of my time for that and had to build it too.

I was heavily inspired of the top DS and the bright people behind it. Still pretty proud of the work and result.
