  @brian_lovin ✋🏼 I’ve been in that position twice. First time I was able to sell the idea of a DS but I had to own that project. As the only designer I just had 25% of my time for that and had to build it too.

I’m now in the same position as the only designer in an early stage startup. But now the process in this company is different. A lot of mock-ups help so I’m building it first in Figma.
