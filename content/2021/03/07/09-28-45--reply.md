  Friends! 🙌🤗 I’ve been invited to a podcast to talk about how to improve collaboration between #design and #development.

  So, I would love to hear your opinion, too! 🙏

  What workflows, tools, and strategies did work well for you and your team to create better work *together*?

No one should have “That’s not my job” moments, respect and involve in each other areas. Bring them early in the design process. I share them quick mock-ups before the client for their opinion and also to know if I’m not making it harder for them than it needs.
