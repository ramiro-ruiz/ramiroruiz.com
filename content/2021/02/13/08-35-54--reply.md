  “If you feel that you just can’t write or you’re too tired or this, that, and the other, just stop thinking about it, and go and work. Life doesn’t have to be so overthought. You don’t have to wait to be inspired. Just start working.”

‪Love it, it reminded me of the turning pro quotes from [@SPressfield](https://twitter.com/@SPressfield) The war of art book.‬
‪“The amateur believes she must first overcome her fear to do her work. The professional knows that fear can never be overcome. She shows up no matter what and do the work”‬
