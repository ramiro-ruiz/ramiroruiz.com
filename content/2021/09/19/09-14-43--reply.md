  My challenge:

  - Sometimes I'm super organized (e.g. collecting feedback, turning it into actionable changes in my product, etc.)
  - However, I tend to lose consistency with this, over time.

  Can you help me? What can I do to become more consistent with the things I should do?

I'm in the same situation, I lose track and throw any excuse to make me feel a little better. 
Something that I'm trying is starting small and make the steps easier to do. “Atomic habits”
