  welp, the rumors were true, Google did in fact buy FitBit: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943318/google-fitbit-acquisition-fitness-tracker-announcement">https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943318/google-fitbit-acquisition-fitness-tracker-announcement</a> I *want* to switch to an Apple watch, but I can't until it has built-in automatic sleep tracking like the FitBit does!

I’ve been using Sleep++ for automatic sleep tracking and is pretty amazing.
