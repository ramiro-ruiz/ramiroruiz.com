[@JustMrLarz](https://mas.to/@JustMrLarz) yeah that would be bad, is not completely automatic. I have to choose what to send that step is where I add the note tags and review the translation to post to my Spanish account.

That helps me avoid confusing posts like you mention. I rarely post live event tweets to my site, and replies are only sent to my website with the original author note for context.
