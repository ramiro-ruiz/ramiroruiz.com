    There are no stupid mistakes
 There are mistakes. These are moments when reality teaches us
 something.
 And there’s stupid. This is what happens when we refuse to
 learn from our mistakes.
“Don’t be stupid” is a fine mantra. It’s particularly apt when talking about cultural forces, political agendas and our thoughtless impulses.
It’s also useful to remember to “make productive and generous mistakes.” And to learn from them.
