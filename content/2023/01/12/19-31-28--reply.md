  <p>I do have conflicting thoughts when looking at this:</p><p><a href="https://t.co/oug85gdHvQ">https://t.co/oug85gdHvQ</a> </p><p>To be honest design education has always been a muddy world. It's one of those things where you could either pay A LOT or pay nothing and the results might just be the same. </p><p>⬇</p>

Completely agree, those prices are crazy.

For beginners I would recommend books that touch on design principles. There’s a lot good YouTube videos, free specific ebooks by [@uxpin](https://twitter.com/@uxpin) or [@InVisionApp](https://twitter.com/@InVisionApp) and actually a [@skillshare](https://twitter.com/@skillshare) membership is pretty great.
