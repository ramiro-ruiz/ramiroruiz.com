> It’s an ode to the video store experience and a nostalgia trip for anyone who remembers the trailers playing before movies on VHS, or having to rewind the tape before you return it. For many of us, the video store wasn’t just a place to rent movies, but a place to hang out and talk film. It was a vastly more social experience than sitting at home scrolling through thumbnails online. We have an almost endless stream of entertainment available at the click of a button, which makes it all the more amazing that a little independent video store can survive in 2020.

Extrañaré estos lugares, grandes recuerdos que tengo. No creo que siga existiendo alguno en Monterrey.
