      <description>I had a wild 2017, not exactly in a good way. Many sad events happened to my family in that year, thankfully our newborn helped us a lot. It gave us those moments of joy we needed.
During many months I lost focus in my training and work, but I needed to get back on my feet. So I started a new business inspired by the trend of productizing your services, aimed to create websites for small companies.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago my father stayed in the hospital around 3 weeks, as in most places in the world, healthcare is very expensive, so he has social insurance which gives you medical care but it comes with a price. Hospitals are packed, few places to sit, little information and I don’t even want to talk about the restrooms.
You’ll see the mid to low income population in those places.</description>

      <title>The Benefit of Constraints</title>

      <description>When I was starting as a designer I regularly complain about restriction, feeling that I needed complete freedom to release my creativity.
I was young and didn’t fear the blank canvas, I would immediately start throwing and moving stuff around but all my results didn’t had any real authenticity and didn’t solve the problem effectively, just trendy designs all over the place, they represent what style I was inspired by in that moment.</description>

      <description>The best resource is understanding English.
Design is a discipline in constant evolution, the foundations and fundamentals will always be important but the implementation, channels, trends, and people change. So you have to be in constant movement and learning.
When you add that the design is aimed at the web or digital products, the speed of how things change increases exponentially. The source of most changes comes from the United States, thanks to its large market, its startups and global popularity, which is why the importance of English.</description>

      <description>On July 23, 2017, I experienced the worst accident I have ever had in my life.
It was a long-awaited weekend, where we went to Cuatrocienegas to have a great time with the family. Everything was excellent and wonderful, we finished going to the main places, the only place that was left before returning home was the marble mine, being there and having seen all I just had this urge to climb the highest stone (8-10 meters approx.</description>

      <description>On my birthday 5 years and 6 months ago on September 9, 2012, I wrote this:
 Hi there, well after so many years being part of the web passive community, today in my birthday I finally decided to make the change and start sharing the little I know and the many questions I ask myself constantly. Maybe I’m starting a bit late but I think I&amp;rsquo;ll take positive things from this instead of not doing it, besides I&amp;rsquo;m a little tired of being one more behind the monitor, of not having my own voice on the web and staying in my area of comfort in a relatively comfortable and stable job.</description>

      <title>Games IHG</title>

      <description>I was contacted by the design agency V09 to help them create a new digital solution for their client. I also been helping IHG for different design projects for the last 5 years. I know them very well, I’ve been in their offices many times and that familiarity from both sides helped to have a smooth process.
V09 had some ideas but they were not sure if they were possible, they wanted a personalized game but the budget didn’t allow them to consider developing a native app/game.</description>
