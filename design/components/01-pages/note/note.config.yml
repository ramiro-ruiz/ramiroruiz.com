          <p>The last 7 days I’ve progressed more in the redesign of my personal website than the last 2 years where I kind of started.</p>
          <p>I wanted big blocks of time. It didn’t work. The excuse, lack of time.</p>
          <p>Now I’m doing a MVP redesign and work on it everyday even when I only have 15min.</p>
